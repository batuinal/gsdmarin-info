===== Master Table Assumptions =====

--> All tables are governed by a "master table".
* Master table's name is "MASTER".
* It has two columns:
  - Page ID (String)
  - Table Name (String)
* MASTER is a dictionary of pages to tables.
* Since each page can hold multiple tables, there can be entities with the same PageID but different Table Name.

--> Changes to CreateTable()
* Now requires an additional input named "Page ID" (string).
* Adds the [PageID --> TableName] mapping to MASTER.
* The rest is its regular functionality. (Don't modify)
* IMPORTANT: Modify MASTER before you create new table!

--> Changes to RemoveTable()
* Removes the entry with "TableName" from MASTER.
* The rest is its regular functionality. (Don't modify)
* IMPORTANT: Modify MASTER before you remove the table!

===== Metatable Assumptions =====

--> There is a "metatable" that contains meta information about each table in each page.
* The metatable is named META.
* Metatable has 3 columns:
  - id (foreign key that corresponds to the id entry in MASTER)
  - Column Name (String)
  - Class (String)
* Metatable is a dictionary of each "column name" to a "class".
  - A "class" is a keyword that our JavaScript will use to generate the proper formatting CSS for that column. 
  - Example: class = "bold_red_small".
* For each column in the original table, there must be exactly ONE entry in the metatable, specifying its "class".

--> Changes to AddAttribute()
* Now requires an additional input named "Class" (string).
* Adds the [Attribute Name --> Class] mapping to the table's metatable.
* The rest is its regular functionality. (Don't modify)
* IMPORTANT: Modify metatable before you add new attribute!

--> Changes to RemoveAttribute()
* Removes the attribute from the table's metatable.
* The rest is its regular functionality. (Don't modify)
* IMPORTANT: Modify metatable before you remove the attribute!
